# dynamicQuizProj
Project for ADV PRG WS: JS

STARTUP:

- The only prerequisite before starting the app.js file is that the user needs to run the "getQuestions.js" file.
    - This will instantiate the local database and the user and question collections.
- Once getQuestions.js is ran, the user may then run the app.js file, which will start the app @ localhost:3000
